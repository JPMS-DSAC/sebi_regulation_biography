In the matter of

Background of the case
1. Following a news article titled "Ranbaxy to sell balance 13.02% stake in Orchid Chem" published in DNA Money on September 18, 2010, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) conducted investigation into the trading in the shares of M/s Orchid Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Limited (Orchid/company).

2. In view of the findings of the investigation as given above, SEBI, vide Order dated August 06, 2012 appointed the undersigned as Adjudicating Officer (AO) under Section 15-I of the SEBI Act, 1992 (SEBI Act) read with Rule 3 of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 (Adjudication Rules) to inquire into and adjudge under Section 15HB of the SEBI Act, the alleged violation of the provisions of Clause 4.2 of Part A, Schedule I under Regulation 12 (1) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 (PIT Regulations).

3. Show Cause Notice dated October 05, 2012 (SCN) was issued to the Noticee in terms of the provision of Rule 4 (1) of the Adjudication Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against him in respect of the violations alleged to have been committed by him.

“I am a senior research professional and do not understand the transactions in shares. I had inadvertently entered into such transactions. I was not aware about the law that being a designated employee of the company, I was prohibited from entering into the purchase and sale of shares of orchid with in a period of 6 months or entering into derivative transactions in the shares of orchid.”
Consideration of Issues, Evidence and Findings
4. I have carefully perused the documents available on record and the submissions of the Noticee. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are:
a. Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Clause 4.2 of Part A, Schedule I under Regulation 12 (1) of PIT Regulations?.
b. Does the violation, if any, on the part of the Noticee attract penalty under section 15HB of SEBI Act?
c. If so, how much penalty should be imposed on the Noticee taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of the SEBI Act?
5. The relevant provisions of the PIT Regulations are as follows:
PIT Regulations, 1992.
Regulation 12 - Code of internal procedures and conduct for listed companies and other entities
Schedule I - Part A, Clause 4.2- All directors/officers/designated employees who buy or sell any number of shares of the company shall not enter into an opposite transaction, i.e., sell or buy any number of shares during the next six months following the prior transaction. All directors/officers/designated employees shall also not take positions in derivative transactions in the shares of the company at any time.

6. I find that the Noticee was a designated employee of the company during the relevant time. I further find that the Noticee was regularly taking positions in derivative segment while dealing in the shares of the company. The following table shows the details of trading done by the Noticee.
7. The above table shows that the Noticee was regularly taking positions in the derivative segment in the shares of the company and has thereby violated the provisions of PIT Regulations.

company, the Noticee is not permitted from taking positions in derivative transactions in the shares of the company at any time.
8. The Noticee has contended that he was not aware of restrictions on designated employees from transacting in derivatives on shares of the company or from doing opposite transactions within 6 months. The Noticee should be aware of the restrictions imposed on him by his employer which are in line with the Code of conduct stipulated by PIT Regulations. The excuse of ignorance of the provisions is not acceptable. Further, it is also observed that the Noticee did numerous transactions in derivatives on Orchid shares over a long period of time which indicates that the Noticee was deliberately violating the restrictions.
9. In view of the foregoing discussions, I find that the Noticee has violated the provisions of Clause 4.2 of Part A, Schedule I under Regulation 12 (1) of PIT regulations. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of SEBI vs. Shri Ram Mutual Fund held that “once the violation of statutory regulations is established, imposition of penalty becomes sine qua non of violation and the intention of parties committing such violation becomes totally irrelevant. Once the contravention is established, then the penalty is to follow.”
10. Thus, the aforesaid violations by the Noticee make him liable for penalty u/s. 15HB of the SEBI Act which reads thus:
15HB.Penalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided.-
"Whoever fails to comply with any provision of this Act, the rules or the regulations made or directions issued by the Board thereunder for whcih no separate penalty has been provided, shall be liable to a penalty which may extend to one crore rupees"
AO order/ Orchid Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals/Senthil Kumar Page 6
11. While determining the quantum of penalty, it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act, which reads as under:-
Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer.
While adjudging quantum of penalty under S.15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:-
(a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default;
(b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default;
(c) the repetitive nature of the default.”
12. It is difficult, in cases of such nature, to quantify exactly the disproportionate gains or unfair advantage enjoyed by an entity and the consequent losses suffered by the investors. It is observed that the Noticee has repeatedly traded in derivatives on shares of Orchid chemicals & Pharmaceuticals Ltd. I am of the considered opinion that directors/ officers/ designated employees are senior functionaries in company who should be aware of the requisite legal provisions and follow the same scrupulously.
ORDER
13. After taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case, I come to conclusion that this is a fit case for imposing the monetary penalty on the aforesaid Noticee. I, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under section 15- I (2) of the SEBI Act, impose a penalty of `. 1,00,000/- Rupees One Lac only) on the Noticee, Senthil Kumar U. P. in terms of Section 15HB of the SEBI Act for violation of Clause 4.2 of Part A, Schedule I under Regulation 12 (1) of PIT Regulations. I am of the view that the said penalty is commensurate with the violation committed by the Noticee.

14. The penalty shall be paid by way of a duly crossed demand draft drawn in favour of “SEBI- Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai within 45 days of receipt of this order. The said demand draft shall be forwarded to General Manager, Investigation Department (IVD-ID6), Securities and Exchange Board of India, Plot no.C4-A, ‘G’ Block, Bandra Kurla Complex, Bandra (E), Mumbai- 400 051.
